A homemade connector for the Casio pocket computer 12-pin accessory connector.

I tried to keep the number of uncommon tools used to a minimum. A 3D printer was used to make the enclosure, but many people have access to a printer these days. A bench-top metal shear which was used to cut 0.025" brass strip to make the connector pins.

The special OSHpark CAM profile was used to get the plated though slots to come out correctly in Eagle.
